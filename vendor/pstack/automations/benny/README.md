# benny

benny gives you two agent automations for slack issue reports. one triages each report. the other reproduces confirmed bugs and may prepare a small draft fix.

the files in this directory are dormant setup and automation sources. they do not appear as slash skills.

## set it up

1. point the agent at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./FOR_AGENTS.md) and name the target repository.
2. let setup merge this whole directory into the target at `.agents/automations/benny/`. it must preserve destination-only files and review conflicts instead of overwriting local edits.
3. let setup install the bundled shared skills in project scope for the worker runtime, with committed files available in the automation checkout.
4. keep user-owned configuration outside the copied pack, for example in `.agents/benny/`. adapt [`configuration.example.yaml`](./templates/configuration.example.yaml) and [`feature-map.example.md`](./skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md).
5. commit the project-scoped skill installation, `.agents/automations/benny/`, and any secret-free configuration before enabling either automation.
6. review each new automation draft or update existing automations in their editors. then send a harmless test report and verify every source-channel post stays in the original thread.
